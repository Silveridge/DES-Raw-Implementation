# DES Raw Implementation
An entirely raw implementation of the Data Encryption Standard in Python.

Note that DES is entirely defunt due to being inadequately secure from modern-day attacks. Please ensure that you use a properly and officially implemented version of AES for data encryption.

## Requirements
Our program requires you to have bitarray 2.7.3 or higher installed.

Bitarray 2.7.3 installation: https://pypi.org/project/bitarray/
